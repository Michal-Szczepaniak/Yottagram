# Installing

Install from openrepos.

You also need our tdlib build (by mister) from [build.merproject.org](https://build.merproject.org/package/show/home:mister/tdlib).

# Developing

First clone Yottagram with subomdules (recursive flag) or just run
```git submodule update --init --recursive```
afterwards.

After opening it in SailfishOS IDE you need to add to qmake parameters
```DEFINES+="APP_TD_API_ID=<id>" DEFINES+="APP_TD_API_HASH=<hash>"```

Now we gotta build submodules. First enter the sfossdk
```ssh -p 2222 -i ~/Programs/SailfishOS/vmshare/ssh/private_keys/sdk mersdk@localhost```
Enter the target you want to use (repeat for every arch, substitute arch/version) and go to Yottagram directory, also you need to add my repo (substitute arch)
```
sb2 -t SailfishOS-4.4.0.58-armv7hl -R
zypper ar https://repo.sailfishos.org/obs/home:/mister/latest_armv7hl/home:mister.repo
zypper ref
cd /home/â€¦/Yottagram
```

First we need to build tg_owt
```
cd Yottagram/vendor/tg_owt/upstream
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=Off -DTG_OWT_USE_PIPEWIRE=off
```
you will get errors so install necessary packages. For example:
```
libjpeg-turbo-devel
protobuf-devel
ffmpeg-devel
opus-devel
libvpx-devel
alsa-lib-devel
pulseaudio-devel
abseil-cpp-devel
```
then you can build it
```make -j$(nproc)```
copy libtg_owt.a to 
```Yottagram/vendor/tg_owt/prebuilds/(arm|arm64|i386)/```
and we're done with tg_owt

You need to also add my repo to sfossdk target, it's basically same ad what we've done just you'll need to add .default to target name probably so like
```
sb2 -t SailfishOS-4.4.0.58-armv7hl.default -R
zypper ar https://repo.sailfishos.org/obs/home:/mister/latest_armv7hl/home:mister.repo
zypper ref
```

You'll also need to remove -lvoicecall from YottagramVoicecallPlugin/upstream/plugins/plugin.pri
